# CitiBike Analysis

## Overview
### Purpose
Investors are considering a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa and want to base it on the Citi Bank bike sharing program in New York City. The bike share data from New York City was doanloaded and analyzed using Tableau to present the data to the investors. The key questions being anaswered in this analysis are: 

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

This analysis shows the use of bikes start time and stop time by day of the week.  When looking at the data, it appears that the start time is bimodal with peaks in morning and afternoon commuting hours during the week days and has more steady useage throughout the days on Saturday and Sunday.

This analysis looked bike use during week days, with gender of useage broken out and if the user was a subscriber to the bike share system. Subscribers seemed to use the bike share more heavily towards the end of the week, Thursday through Saturday than early week days.

This figure looked at the time that the bikes were ridden between subscribers and customers. It seemed as though subscribers are utilizing the bike share more during commuting hours where customers are opting to utilize the bike share more during weekends and non-peak commuting hours.

This image shows a graph of gender and time of day that the bike share is utilized and how long of a trip the user rode for. Aside from the much higher number of male users, the graph shows an sharper increase in ride duration by males than females.

There is a much higher number of male bike share users, than female users. Even if unknown users were female, it would still not equate to equal bike share useage between genders.

When looking at the breakdown of peak hours that the bikes are utilized, commuting hours seem to have the highest number of rides. This would be around 7-8am and 4-6pm.

This analysis looks at the breakdown of bike trips by weekday, hour by hour, and differentiates males, females, and unknown genders.

## Summary
This analysis helped to get an idea of what the Des Moines bike share program could look like using numbers from New York City in August. This is just a small snapshot in time of data, but it likely represents the peak season for the bike share program. We can see from the data that there is a higher user base among males than females and subscribers primarily use the bike share program to commute to work during peak morning and afternoon hours.  Customers tend to utilize the program on weekends throughout the day.

### Suggestions for future analyses 
For future analyses I would suggest looking at more age-related data. We looked at the correlation of rider age and length of rides, but I would be more interested to know about the ages of subscribers versus customers. I would want to analyze the length of time that bikes are checked out per day. This would help nail down if the bikes are used for longer periods of time on weekends versus weekday commutes.  Knowing this information could help plan when to perform bike maintainance. This analysis was only performed for the month of August in New York City.  Knowing what kind of bike share useage was going on during other months could help Des Moines have a fuller picture of a full year of the bike share program.
