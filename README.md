# CitiBike Analysis

## Overview
### Purpose
Investors are considering a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa and want to base it on the Citi Bank bike sharing program in New York City. The bike share data from New York City was doanloaded and analyzed using Tableau to present the data to the investors. The key questions being anaswered in this analysis are: 

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

This analysis shows the use of bikes start time and stop time by day of the week.  When looking at the data, it appears that the start time is bimodal with peaks in morning and afternoon commuting hours during the week days and has more steady useage throughout the days on Saturday and Sunday.

This analysis looked bike use during week days, with gender of useage broken out and if the user was a subscriber to the bike share system. Subscribers seemed to use the bike share more heavily towards the end of the week, Thursday through Saturday than early week days.

There is a much higher number of male bike share users, than female users. Even if unknown users were female, it would still not equate to equal bike share useage between genders.

When looking at the breakdown of peak hours that the bikes are utilized, commuting hours seem to have the highest number of rides. This would be around 7-8am and 4-6pm.

## Summary
### Suggestions for future analyses 
For future analyses I would suggest looking at more age-related data. We looked at the correlation of rider age and length of rides, but I would be more interested to know about the ages of subscribers versus customers.
